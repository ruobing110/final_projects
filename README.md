# Final projects introduction

## 1. Background information
The project aims at analyzing the relation between Beijing house price data and subway station data as well as time. 

Dataset used:
* Subway station geological data
* House sale price data (2011-2017) 
* Rent house data price data 

## 2. Project proposal

* Assume the house sale price keep increasing from 2011 to 2017. If not, find out policy factors cause the difference. 
* Assume that the house sale price is influenced by trade time, July and August might be the highest during a year.  
* People will be likely to pay more to buy or rent a house near to a metro station. The price will decrease as the distance between house and metro station increase, e.g house price decrease 1000 RMB every KM further from metro station.
