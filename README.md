# Final projects introduction

## 1. Background information
The project aims at analyzing the relation between Beijing house price data and subway station data as well as time. 

Dataset used:
* Subway station geological data
* House sale price data (2011-2017) 
* Rent house data price data 

## 2. Project proposal

* Assume the house sale price keep increasing from 2011 to 2017. If not, find out policy factors cause the difference. 
* Assume that the house sale price is influenced by trade time, July and August might be the highest during a year.  
* People will be likely to pay more to buy or rent a house near to a metro station. The price will decrease as the distance between house and metro station increase, e.g house price decrease 1000 RMB every KM further from metro station. 

## 3. Result representation

* Proposal 1: (Assume the house sale price keep increasing from 2011 to 2017. If not, find out policy factors cause the difference. )
>The boxplot shows that the most of the time the house price keep rising, from around 20,000 to around 6000.  But two time period deserves focus. One is the dramatical increase happens from 2016 Feb, and the other is the sudden decrease from 2017 April. The result of first hypothyse is not that accurate.

>In order to know what happens cause the rise and fall in the gram, we search the news reported and policies released at that time. According to several reports. We find out the policy which cause the variation. 
By early 2016, the Chinese government introduced a series of measures to increase property purchases, including lower taxes on home sales, limiting land sales for new development projects, and the third in a series of mortgage down payment reductions. 

From Bloomberg Business, a report on February 2016, shows that China’s central bank will allow banks to cut the minimum required mortgage down payment to 20%. And minimum down payment required for second homes cut to 30%. The policy boost people floods in property market. And the price of properties goes up quickly.

>In 2017, Beijing Municipal Government release a strict property-purchasing limitations. As there are many wealthy people trying to buy multiple property and then sell it for profit. This time the property-purchasing limitations aims at raise the down-payment requirements.  <br>

Beijing Municipal Government issued new rules limiting the number of homes each family can buy as the government steps up efforts to cool the property market. 
The new rules ban Beijing families who own two or more apartments and non-Beijing registered families who own one or more apartment from buying more homes. and the new rules allow banks to further raise the down-payment requirements for apartment buyers and raise interest rates on mortagages. The minimum down payment requirements was raised to 35% for first home and 60% for the second homes
